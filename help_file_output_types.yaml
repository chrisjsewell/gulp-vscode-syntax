marvin:

    generates a file suitable for input to Marvin for
    surface calculations. Index of surface plane needs to be
    added first, though this may be passed through GULP to the
    marvin input but using the "marvin" option. If the file
    extension ".mvn" is not given by the user it will be added
    by the program.

    e.g. output marvin alumina produces alumina.mvn

    If a file for Marvin2 is required, then use the sub-option
    marvin2 instead.

    e.g. output marvin2 alumina

thbrel:

    converts the final bulk structure into a file format
    suitable for the THBREL suite of programs. Not all features
    are readily transferable between the programs so no guarantee
    is made that the input file is perfect and for similar reasons
    both programs may not always yield the same results unless the
    user is careful to make sure the files are equivalent. If a
    phonon run has been requested then the output is modified for
    THBPHON instead of THBREL.

xtl:

    this is only applicable to crystal structures with a
    single structure per file. Produces a .xtl file for input
    into the BIOSYM software, though use of the archive file is
    better unless symmetry is present. If the filename input is
    not already terminated with ".xtl" then this will be added
    by the program.
    e.g. output xtl alumina produces alumina.xtl

xr:

    this will output a modified CSSR file suitable for
    input into the Oxford Materials graphical interface
    program Crysalis. The file will have the extension ".xr"
    added. At the moment this is only applicable to 3D
    systems.

    e.g. output xr alumina produces alumina.xr

cssr:

    this will output a CSSR file suitable for input
    into the MSI graphical interface Cerius2. The file will
    have the extension ".cssr" added. At the moment this
    is only applicable to 3D systems.

    e.g. output cssr alumina produces alumina.cssr

arc:

    alternatively known as a ".car" file. This option produces
    archive files suitable for input into the BIOSYM Insight software
    and will handle bulk, cluster and defect calculations, all with
    multiple structures. The username should input a root name,
    e.g. output arc alumina
    The program will then produce archive file names with either
    "_3D", "_defe", or "_0D" appended to distinguish the files
    resulting from a particular section of the run. If multiple
    structures are present then an underscore followed by the
    structure number will be added, all followed by ".arc".
    e.g. if the above input for alumina contained two bulk structures
    then the files produced would be "alumina_bulk_1.arc" and
    "alumina_bulk_2.arc".
    If the word "movie" is specified then all structures during an
    optimisation will be included in the arcfile, rather than just
    the final one, so that the optimisation may be viewed.
    e.g. output movie arc alumina
    NB for MD runs the name of the archive file is set by
    "mdarchive" to avoid overwriting the optimisation archive
    file if present. Also in the case of MD the file is only
    written during the production phase.
    It is also possible to specify a frequency for the output

    e.g. output movie 5 arc alumina

    This would output an archive file frame every 5 steps during the
    movie. The default is to output at every step.
    NB The residue field has now been changed to contain the molecule
    number, rather than the atom number or a dummy string.

xyz:

    this will output an xyz file suitable for
    input into programs such as Molden and with slight
    modification Unichem. The file will have the extension ".xyz"
    At the moment this is only applicable to non-periodic
    systems. When called with a periodic case just the Cartesian
    coordinates will be output, without the unit cell.
    e.g. output xyz cluster produces cluster.xyz
    If the word "movie" is specified then all structures during an
    optimisation will be included in the xyz file, rather than just
    the final one, so that the optimisation may be viewed.
    e.g. output movie xyz cluster

trajectory:

    this is a binary file which stores the coordinates
    and velocities from a molecular dynamics run, as well as some
    of the system properties. This file is used by the Cerius interface
    to generate a .trj file for analysis in Cerius. Note that this
    file is only written during the production phase by default.
    e.g. output trajectory alumina
    For this sub-option the further option "ascii" may be specified
    in order to obtain an ASCII format trajectory file. Note that
    this is less efficient for disk space usage!
    e.g. output trajectory ascii alumina
    Furthermore, the sub-option "equil" may be added to force writing
    during the equilibration phase of the simulation.
    The default extension for this file type is .trg

history:

    this is a text file in the DLPOLY HISTORY file format
    containing the structure and velocities sampled from a MD run.
    This file can be used for post-MD analysis using the same
    programs as for DLPOLY such as "After".

fdf:

    this is a text file in the Flexible Data Format of Alberto
    Garcia and Jose M. Soler. This file can then form the basis of
    an input deck for the program SIESTA.

drv:

    this is a text file containing the energy and appropriate
    derivatives calculated by GULP at the last function evaluation.
    This can be used for QM/MM schemes. Note that if freezing is
    being used then second derivatives may not be output since not
    all derivatives may be calculated. To turn off freezing then
    specify the keyword "noexclude".

frc:

    this is a text file containing the energy and appropriate
    force constants for cores only calculated by GULP during a phonon
    calculation. This can be used for QM/MM schemes, such as in the
    program QMPOT. A phonon calculation must be specified otherwise
    no file will be output. 
    NB Force constant matrices can also be
    output in a format suitable for ShengBTE and Phonopy using the
    output shengbte option.

cif:

    this is only applicable to crystal structures with a
    single structure per file. Produces a .cif file for input
    into a variety of programs. If the filename input is
    not already terminated with ".cif" then this will be added
    by the program. Note that at present the files are output
    in P1 regardless of symmetry for simplicity.
    e.g. output cif alumina produces alumina.cif
    Strictly speak a cif file is only valid for 3-D systems, but
    files can be output from GULP for 0-D, 1-D and 2-D with the
    addition of a dummy cell parameter. This value can be set
    from the option

    e.g. output cif 12.0 surface

    will create a 3-D cif file with a dummy lattice parameter of
    12 Angstroms for directions that are non-periodic. The default
    dummy lattice parameter is 0 which implies that a cif file
    shouldn't be written for the wrong periodicity.

str:

    this is a file in the CRYSTAL98 format, suitable for
    reading by DLV. If the filename input is not already
    terminated with ".str" then this will be added. If multiple
    structures are specified then the filename will be modified
    so that a separate file can be written for each structure.

phonon:

    this option leads to the density of states from a
    phonon calculation and any dispersion curve points being
    output to the files <filename>.dens and <filename>.disp,
    respectively, in a format suitable for input into a curve
    plotting program. If the sub-option "ir" is specified then
    the density of states will be weighted by the IR intensities
    e.g. output phonon ir alumina

frequency:

    this option produces a list of frequencies over all
    k points for use in an analysis program. A typical application
    might be in the calculation of the Gruneisen parameter by
    differencing of the frequencies with respect to the cell volume.
    The file can either be output in binary format (to maintain
    precision - the default)

    e.g. output freq binary <filename> <ndecimal>

    or as ordinary text

    e.g. output freq text <filename> <ndecimal>

    Here the optional value of ndecimal specifies how many decimal
    places you get (up to a maximum of 12 since going further than
    this would be non-sensical in double precision!).

pressure:

    this option outputs a file containing the pressure
    tensor during a molecular dynamics run, both instanteously and
    as an average. File is output as <filename>.pre using units of
    GPa.

osc:

    this is a text file containing the oscillator strengths
    for the phonon modes so that the frequency dependent data can
    be handled in post processing. In this file the frequencies
    are in wavenumbers, while the oscillator strengths are in cm^-2

pdf:

    this option sets the name for the .wid and .pdf files
    created by the pdf keyword. The .wid file can be suppressed by
    the nowidth keyword.

cosmo:

    this outputs a COSMO file in the Accelrys format for
    visualisation of information relating to solvation an the
    solvent accessible surface

lammps:

    this outputs a LAMMPS input files for a system based on
    the information available to GULP. This includes a .lmp file
    containing the structure and bonding information. If followed by
    "var" then variable names will be used in the output.

lammps_pots:

    this outputs a LAMMPS file containing a tabulation
    of any twobody potentials. There are 3 addition pieces of information
    that can be provided which are the start of the range, r0, the end
    of the range, rend, and the number of points, np.
    e.g. output lammps_pots 0.1 9.0 1000 myfile
    This would create a table from 0.1 to 9.0 Angstroms with 1000 points
    and write it to a file called myfile.

cml:

    this is a Chemical Markup Language output file which
    contains all the important information about the calculation
    in an XML format. This output is suitable for various database
    tools and for data transfer between CML-enabled applications.

eig:

    this outputs the eigenvectors for each K point as a file.

qbo:

    this file contains the charges and bond orders, as appropriate,
    for a potential model.
    e.g. output qbo myfile
    The above command would produce a file myfile.qbo containing the
    charges and bond orders for the final configuration. If the
    values for all structures are required then the sub-option "append"
    can be used

    e.g. output qbo append myfile

dcd:

    this file contains the coordinates from an MD trajectory and
    can be used by programs such as VMD for analysis and visualisation.

inertia:

    output information on the moment of inertia tensor for
    molecules at the final structure for each configuration

castep_phonon:

    this file contains the phonon information from multiple
    K points in the same format as used for the program CASTEP. The default
    extension for this is ".csp"
    e.g. output castep_phon myfile.csp

kpt:

    this file list the k points within the asymmetric unit of the
    Brillouin zone along with the symmetry unique images of the k point.

shengBTE:

    this causes the files needed to perform a ShengBTE run to be
    output. This usually comprises the files CONTROL, FORCE_CONSTANTS_2ND,
    FORCE_CONSTANTS_3RD that contain the system information and control
    parameters, the second order force constants, and the third order force
    constants, respectively. Note that the FORCE_CONSTANTS_2ND file is also
    suitable for use with Phonopy.
    NB Since the calculation of the third order force constants is
    potentially expensive expect this option to substantially increase
    the computational cost of a run!!! The use of the keyword nod3 allows
    the ShengBTE output to be restricted to second derivatives only.
    NB The option "threshold" controls the minimum size for force constants
    to be output as non-zero

dipole:

    this causes GULP to output a text file that contains the
    dipole of the system for each time step of a molecular dynamics run.
    If the delta_dipole keyword is specifed then the dipole is computed
    relative to the initial value. The units of the dipoles for this file
    are Debye and the format has the current time in ps follow by the
    three Cartesian components in the order x, y and z.

xsf:

    output a file in XCrySDen format. When performing MD it is possible
    to output either a single XSF file or a sequence of files for single
    frames with a number appended to differentiate them. The format is

    output xsf <seq/sym> myfile

    where seq (sequential) is optional but if specified will result in multiple
    files being output during molecular dynamics. Here myfile is the root name
    for the file. For example;

    output xsf seq myfile

    would produce myfile000001.xsf, myfile000002.xsf, etc. If "sym" is specified
    then atomic symbols are used instead of atomic numbers in the files. This
    is relevant if using Aenet which expects symbols, whereas XCrySDen specifies
    atomic numbers for the format.
